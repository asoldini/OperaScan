# OperaScan
A quick python scan of a pdf to help a friend file her record's information in a CSV

The only records that were given to her were a pdf output. The regularity of the file, however, made for to be very easy to scan with a pdf to xml library that was very searchable with the BeautifulSoup package. 

This hour project saved my friend over three hours of manual data entry.
